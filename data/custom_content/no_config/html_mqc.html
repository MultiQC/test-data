<h1>MultiQC Custom Content HTML File</h1>
<p class="lead">After MultiQC v1.9 you can just throw a file with HTML at MultiQC and it will appear, as long as it has a <code>_mqc.html</code> suffix.</p>
<p>Note that this is injected into the MultiQC report, so custom JavaScript and CSS may do strange stuff.</p>
